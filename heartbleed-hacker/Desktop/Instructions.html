<h1> Instructions for Reproducing the Heartbleed Bug </h1>

<ol>
<li> On the container list, click the "Console" icon for the Server container to launch a new terminal window.</li>
<li> Determine the IP address of the Server by typing <i>ifconfig</i> at the terminal prompt. </li>
<li> On the Hacker VNC window, launch the Firefox web browser from the bottom left corner. </li>
<li> Attempt to login to the Server webpage by navigating to the Server's IP address in Firefox. </li>
<li> Typically, a Hacker is unaware of the valid login details for such a website; <br/> we will show 
how the HeartBleed bug can be exploited to circumvent this requirement and access secured webpages on 
the Server.</li>
<li> On the Victim VNC window, launch the Firefox web browser from the bottom left corner. </li>
<li> Navigate to the Server's IP address in the browser. </li>
<li> Login with the username <i>foo</i> and password <i>bar</i>. </li>
<li> At this point, the user has logged in to the Server. The Server uses session cookies, so that the user 
does not need to re-login to the Server unless they close the browser window.</li>
<li> In a new browser tab on the Victim, navigate to the Server's IP again. You should see the Welcome message 
instead of being prompted to login again. This is the session cookie in action. </li>
<li> The Hacker will exploit this fact and the Heartbleed bug, to retrieve session cookies from the Server. </li>
<li> On the Hacker VNC window, launch a terminal from the bottom left corner, under Administrative Tools.</li>
<li> At the terminal prompt, run <i>python Hacker.py [Server's IP]</i>. The script should run and either print out 
the retrieved session cookie; or fail to print anything.</li>
<li> If a session cookie is obtained, set that token in the Hacker's browser as follows:
<ol>
<li> Open a new browser tab and navigate to the Server's IP address.</li>
<li> From the top right corner in the browser window, click the icon with the three horizontal lines, then select <i>Web Developer</i>, 
followed by <i>Storage Inspector</i>.</li>
<li> You should see a console at the bottom of the browser window, with a <i>Cookies</i> section in the pane on the left, and an 
entry for the Server's IP address.</li>
<li> Click on the <i>Value</i> entry, and paste the session cookie obtained by running the Hacker.py script there.</li>
<li> Now navigate to the Server's IP address again in this browser tab, and you should be presented with the Welcome message as if, 
you have logged in successfully.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Note that you may need to re-run the Hacker.py script several times to obtain the session cookie and try setting them 
in your Hacker browser.</li>
</ol>
